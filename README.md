# Multithreading-Regen-Power-Tech
In this project we scraped data for multiple customers using multithreading in python. The values of username, password, startdate and enddate were directly fetched from a csv file and passed into a function which was called using the thread. All the scapped data for every particular date was saved in different folers on the basis of client names.
